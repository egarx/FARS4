The functions programmed using data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes. 

## Steps to run the functions:

2. This function reads data from .csv file
3. Make data file name
4. Read FARS years
5. Summarize FARS data by years.
